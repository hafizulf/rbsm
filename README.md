# RBSM

## Short description about what is RBSM ?

RBSM is a simple social media API-only application based on Ruby lang. This app is used only on one small environment so no authentication is required. Where the user can input data, create a new post with a limit of 1000 characters and a maximum of one attachment. Users can also make comments, check some posts that contain certain hashtags and users can also see trending hashtags for the past 24 hours.
